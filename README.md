# dm-q3
- hosting webapp built with streamlit and awesome-streamlit with herokuapp.

check the website out @ https://dm-q3.herokuapp.com/

as the heroku free dyno is deprecating, we have created a new website hosting on streamlit itself to show case the project.

in case the heroku link is not working, check out the website @ https://dm-q3-zjmx.streamlitapp.com/

as streamlit is not hosting the site based on custom runtime as heroku, we need to remove the version in requirements.txt in order for the packages to be installed compatible with the current python version.
